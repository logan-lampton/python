<h1>The Best Movies According to Logan</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Monty Python's The Holy Grail</h3>
<p>A comedy so great that they named a decent programming language after it.</p>
<h3>Nightcrawler</h3>
<p>A dark look at sensational news that is too good to look away.</p>
<h3>Star Wars</h3>
<p>The original sci-fi epic that started it all; it even has laser swords!</p>
