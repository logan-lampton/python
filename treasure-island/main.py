You struggle as you pull it through the sand to the river and it seems old and in bad shape. But she floats well enough to get across the river safely.\nYou disembark and find yourself at the strange remains of the ship. Something seems off about this whole building, and not just the too perfect of angles of a ramshackle structure made out of materials not for the purpose of creating a building. You get a chill staring at that forsaken jumble of wood. It's at that point that you notice three doors, each a different color. Time for a difficult choice.")
